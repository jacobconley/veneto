`veneto-lang`
======

**The Veneto Language** is an ergonomic and expressive domain modeling language to define data formats and API flows.  

This repository contains the parser, written in Rust.  It'll also contain Language Server functionality soon, 
which will be compiled to WASM and integrated as a VSCode extension soon.  
 
There's much more to come on this page, but for the best glance at what this project is about, check out the [announcement post](https://www.jakeconley.com/posts/2023-02-07_veneto-announcement.htm). 

This project is organized on [Notion](https://veneto.notion.site), which contains our public roadmap as well as all up-to-date documentation about the state of the project.
